Overview
========

This library provides filters similar in some ways to ``list_filter`` and
``date_hierarchy`` in Django's admin, but for use outside the
admin. Importantly, it also includes result counts for the choices. It is
designed to be very easy to get started with.

Install
=======

::

    pip install django-easyfilters
